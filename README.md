# Multi-Layer-Neural-Network-using-NumPy

The neural network model in this assignment is a multi-layer of neurons with multiple nodes in each layer.                                       
The activation (transfer) function of all the nodes is assumed to be a sigmoid function.                                           
Model weights should include the bias(es).                                            
code should be vectorized using numpy.
